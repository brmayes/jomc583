To run a local server using node.js:

1.) Go to the folder you want to run the server.
2.) Type "npm install -g serve"
3.) Make sure the server is running. Type "which serve"
4.) Tell the server which folder to run on. Type "serve -p 3000"* in the folder that you want to run the server on.
** The server number can be almost anything. Some are reserved, but most can be used.

To stop running the server, go to your terminal and press ctr + c.
